# template-sql

Template-sql is a Node.js library that lets you treat your SQL queries like templatesâ€”think of it as handlebars for SQL. Instead of embedding raw SQL in your code, you can store your queries in separate files and have them loaded and cached in memory when your app starts. This means you get clean, maintainable SQL with a performance boost from in-memory caching, making it easier to build complex queries without clutter.
